# StorageBaby

Git-driven configuration for my self-hosted services and the Arch hosts they
run on. Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-gitops-podman-platform-design.md`.

## Layout

- `hosts/<host>/host.yml` — everything specific to one host (domain, storage
  roots, later disks/snapraid/samba).
- `hosts/<host>/services/<name>/` — a service placed on that host.
- `hosts/shared/services/<name>/` — a service that runs on every host.
- `ansible/` — the site playbook and roles that turn the above into a running host.
- `tests/` — static checks and the Molecule integration scenario.

Each service folder holds `service.yml` (port, domain, volumes, secrets,
backup policy), `quadlet/*.j2` (Podman Quadlet units), optional `config/`, and
`secrets.sops.yaml`.

## New host

Copy the script to the fresh Arch install and run it as root:

    scp bootstrap.sh root@<host>:/root/ && ssh root@<host> 'bash /root/bootstrap.sh --repo git@github.com:janlucaklees/StorageBaby.git'

`stable` is created by CI on the first green push to master, so push and let CI
run before bootstrapping the first host.

Add the printed deploy key to the repository, add the printed age recipient to
`.sops.yaml` under the host's rule, run `make sops FILE=...` → `sops updatekeys`
on the affected secrets, commit, push. The host pulls `stable` every 5 minutes.

Until the host's age recipient is in `.sops.yaml` and `sops updatekeys` has run
on the secret files it needs, its first converge fails at secret decryption.
That is expected: the host cannot read anything it was not encrypted to.

## Operating a service

Every service runs as its own lingering user `svc-<name>`, so its units belong
to that user's systemd manager, not the system one. Run these as root:

    systemctl --user -M svc-traefik@ status traefik.service
    systemctl --user -M svc-traefik@ restart traefik.service

`journalctl` has no `--user -M` equivalent, so read logs by unit name instead:

    journalctl _SYSTEMD_USER_UNIT=traefik.service -f

Nothing is ever changed on a host by hand — this is for looking, and for the
occasional restart. The fix belongs in git.

## Working on the repo

    make devtools              # build the tooling image (once)
    make format                # prettier over the whole repo
    make fmt-check             # check only, no writes
    make test-static           # contract, secrets, render checks
    make test-integration      # Molecule scenario test-ci in a KVM VM
    make molecule CMD=converge # a single Molecule step in that scenario
    make molecule-login        # SSH into the running test VM
    make test-clean            # destroy the VM and drop the Molecule cache
    make sops FILE=hosts/shared/services/traefik/secrets.sops.yaml
    make install-hooks         # once per clone: lefthook's formatting hook

Docker and lefthook are all the workstation needs for everything but the
integration tests. Those drive real KVM machines through the host's libvirt, so
they additionally need `qemu-base libvirt dnsmasq iptables-nft`, `libvirtd`
enabled, and libvirt's `default` network active. On a machine that also runs
Docker, set `firewall_backend = "iptables"` in `/etc/libvirt/network.conf` —
with the nftables backend Docker's rules drop the VM network's traffic.
